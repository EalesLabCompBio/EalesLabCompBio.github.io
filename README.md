# Eales Lab | University of Manchester

Welcome to the Eales lab!
We are an academic research lab who work to understand cardiovascular disease processes using computational methods and large multiomic data sets. We are part of the [Division of Cardiovascular Sciences](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/organisations/division-of-cardiovascular-sciences) at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). 

Our main GitHub is [here](https://github.com/EalesLabCompBio)

James Eales, PhD - Lecturer in Cardiovascular Computational Biology and Principal Investigator
We run in-silico experiments to investigate the biological mechanisms causal to cardiovascular disease.
We do multiomics, deep-learning, molecular diagnostics, translational research, single-cell transcriptomics.
We are interested in understanding more about the biology behind hypertension, coronary artery disease, kidney histopathology and alternative splicing.
