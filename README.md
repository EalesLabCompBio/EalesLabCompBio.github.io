# Eales Lab at The University of Manchester

Welcome to the Eales lab!
We are an academic research lab who work to understand cardiovascular disease processes using computational methods and large multiomic data sets. We are part of the [Division of Cardiovascular Sciences](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/organisations/division-of-cardiovascular-sciences) at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/).
