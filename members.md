### James Eales - Lecturer in Cardiovascular Computational Biology and Principal Investigator   

![james-small-github](https://github.com/EalesLabCompBio/EalesLabCompBio.github.io/assets/1412565/4e6cc27a-9eb0-4579-97a6-bae8df237707)   
We run in-silico experiments to investigate the biological mechanisms causal to cardiovascular disease.
We do multiomics, deep-learning, molecular diagnostics, translational research, single-cell transcriptomics.
We are interested in understanding more about the biology behind hypertension, coronary artery disease, kidney histopathology and alternative splicing.
